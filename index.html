      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Owen Young. I'm a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and soon to be grad student at University of Washington.
        I studied physics, mathematics, and computer science at Reed College and have no clue what field of physics I hope to specialize in in grad school.
        Throughout my time in college and now in my gap year, I've taken on various projects extending my acedemic interests down avenues not
        taken in school or work. Sharing these projects in a more personal manner than simply through GitHub is one of my main goals with website. In fact,
        this website is itself one of these projects.
      </p>
      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <h3>Building a Website</h3>
      <h3>N-Body Simulations</h3>
      <h3>GPU Programming</h3>
      <h3>Digital Electronics Essentials</h3>
      <h3>Building an 8-Bit Computer</h3>
      <h3>An Audio Visualizer</h3>
      <h3>Electromagnetism Historical Demos<h3>
